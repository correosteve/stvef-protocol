`stvef` protocol handler for https://efservers.com/.

To get this working in Firefox, you have to open `about:config`. Once there, enter `network.protocol-handler.expose.stvef` in the search field and create it as a boolean. Once created, set the value to `false`.

Based on https://github.com/stefansundin/vlc-protocol.
