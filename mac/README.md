## Install holomatch

Download a release from one of:
- https://github.com/Daggolin/tulip-voyager
- https://github.com/zturtleman/lilium-voyager

Drag the `.app` to `/Applications/`. You need to copy your `baseEF` files to `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Tulip Voyager/baseEF` or `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Lilium Voyager/baseEF`. You can get a copy of the files from https://holomat.ch/ (download the Linux version).

Be sure to turn on `Auto Downloading` in the game settings.

Note that in Tulip Voyager, the key combination to bring up the console is <kbd>Shift + ~</kbd>.
